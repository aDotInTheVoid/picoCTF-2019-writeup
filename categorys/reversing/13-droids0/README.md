First you need to install [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). I find the best way is to use [jetbrains toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

Then open the apk.

You'll need to finagle android studio into having a virual device, but their are other better guides to do that. Once you have, press the green arrow in the top right
